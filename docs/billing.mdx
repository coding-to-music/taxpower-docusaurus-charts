- **On the 24th of each month, you will receive a pre-charge notification email that explains how much will be charged to your account on the 27th of that month.**
- **On the 27th of each month, the payment method associated with your account will be charged.**
- **On the 28th of the month, you will receive either a successful charge notification email, or a charge failure notification email.**
- **If a charge failure occurs, you will have a grace period of 15 days from the notification of failure to add a new payment method. After those 15 days are up, if you haven't submitted a new payment method, then you will not be able to make anymore successful requests to the TaxPower API until the previous bill is paid.**
- **You can find your current billing status in the [TaxPower Developer Console](https://www.taxpower.com/developer-console).**

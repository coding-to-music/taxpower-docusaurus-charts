## Use Your API Key To Make An Authenticated Request To the TaxPower API

:::note

### Requirements

 - **A TaxPower Account. If you still need to signup, you can find the instructions [here](../account-setup).**
 - **A TaxPower API key. If you still need to acquire one, you can find the instructions [here](../generate-api-key).** 

:::

If you have a valid [TaxPower API key](../generate-api-key), and want to make a request to the TaxPower API to calculate tax, you have a couple options.

- **GUI Client Applications**
    > There are many applications that allow a user to interact with an [HTTP API](https://www.educative.io/blog/what-are-rest-apis). You should choose this option if you don't know how to program, or just want to interact with the live API quickly to determine if the API is suitable for your needs.

     The TaxPower development team recommends the [Postman](https://www.postman.com/product/what-is-postman/) application. If you would like to choose this option, click [here](./postman).

- **Programming Language That Supports HTTP Communication**
    > Any programming language with an HTTP library can be used to communicate with the TaxPower API.

    The TaxPower Development team has provided quick start guides for a few of the more common backend programming languages.
